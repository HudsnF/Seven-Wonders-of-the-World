                <p>"For the longest time (we’re talking millennia here), we had the Seven Wonders of the World.
                    There was just one problem for the demanding 21st century travel set.
                    Except for the ever durable Great Pyramids of Egypt, the rest were nothing more than distant
                    memories
                    from a hazy history.
                    Want to see the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or the Colossus of Rhodes? You missed that boat by many
                    centuries. A rendering in a book or online is the best you’ll ever do.
                    The solution? In 2007, a global contest was held and more than 100 million votes were cast for the
                    New
                    Seven Wonders of the World.
                    And while many of them are very old, they’re still here! These are durable destinations where we can
                    actually go see the wonders – and take a selfie for posterity." <a

                        Chichen
                        Itza is the most
                        famous symbol of the once mighty Mayan civilization. Archaeologists believe Chichen Itza emerged
                        as a major economic and cultural center around 600 AD and grew for several centuries.
                        It was eventually abandoned and lost to nature in modern Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The ruins
                        weren’t uncovered until 1841, and it’s only become a big tourist destination in recent decades.
                        The pyramid of El Castillo (“The Castle”) is probably the best known structure of the once vast
                        city.
                        <span>Best time go:</span> Go early in the morning before it gets too hot and cruise ship
                        passengers from
                        Cancun arrive. People also go for spring and fall equinoxes for an unbelievable shadow show –
                        but expect huge crowds then.

                        taken its
                        place in the
                        pantheon of historic wonders. Standing 30 meters (98 feet) tall and outstretched arms spanning
                        28 meters (92 feet), the simple but mesmerizing white statue of Art Deco design has an amazing
                        view over Rio de Janeiro.
                        It’s one of the most magnificent meetings of natural and man-made beauty in the world.
                        <span>Best time go:</span> Rio tends to be drier (better for those spectacular views) but also
                        hotter in
                        December through February. Afternoons have bigger crowds generally. Mornings are better for
                        taking pictures of the statue; afternoons are better for taking pictures of the city panorama.
                        Expect more people during weekends and Rio’s Carnival.

                        animal
                        contests, chariot
                        races and even mock naval battles. And say what you will about their entertainment choices, they
                        built a Colosseum to last.
                        Emperor Vespasian ordered the construction around 71 AD, and it was dedicated in 80 AD during
                        the rule of his son Titus. It held around 50,000 spectators and even had a retractable awning to
                        shield Romans.
                        Given how quickly stadiums come and go in the modern age, it makes this feat of engineering all
                        the more amazing. And this freestanding structure sits in the middle of a bustling, modern-day
                        Rome.
                        <span>Best time go:</span> You’ll find fewer tourists there during Rome’s low season (winter),
                        weekdays
                        and during the opening hour (8:30 a.m.) or near closing time (varies during time of year). If
                        you show up in summer at midday, it’s going to be hot!

                    <p class="paragraph4 hidden">The Great Wall began around 220 BC, and construction continued for
                        millennia. Its purpose: Keep
                        nomadic people to the north out of China. Eventually, it couldn’t hold back the Mongols, who
                        successfully invaded in the 13th century anyway and set up shop in what’s now Beijing under the
                        direction of Kublai Khan.
                        However, the Great Wall has turned out to be a great way to usher an invasion of tourists (and
                        their money) into China in recent decades.
                        Stretching for 8,852 kilometers (5,500 miles) along the best-preserved Ming Dynasty portion of
                        the superstructure, its travel appeal is obvious. In the words of UNESCO’s page on the wall:
                        It’s “an outstanding example of the superb military architecture, technology and art of ancient
                        China.”
                        <span>Best time go:</span> Plan for a spring or fall trip when the weather is nicer and fewer
                        people
                        visit. Summertime is often hot and crowded, and winter can be bitterly cold in northern China.

                        But oh what rewards you’ll find: the most splendid example of Incan architecture placed in a
                        jaw-dropping landscape of tropical mountain forest. There are about 200 structures in this
                        religious and agricultural center set on a steep ridge crisscrossed by terraces of stone.
                        Amazingly, it was in active use only a short time, historically speaking. The Inca built it in
                        the 15th century, but it was abandoned after the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.
                        <span>Best time go:</span> Dry season, which runs April to October (though weather in the Andes
                        is hard to
                        predict). Peak crowds are June through August. Because of the fragile nature of the area, new
                        ticketing rules limit the number of tourists at at any given time – so you must book for a
                        morning or afternoon slot.

                        People today may recognize it from the 1989 movie “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” but
                        during the classical heydays of Greece and Rome, it was known as an important caravan stop
                        between the Mediterranean and the Far East. By the 7th century AD, it was abandoned. But its
                        desert location preserved much of it through the centuries
                        No wonder it mesmerizes visitors today – its blend of Eastern and Hellenistic styles, half-built
                        and half-carved into the natural red sandstone of the area, truly deserves the term “unique.”

                        elaborate tomb and an enduring
                        symbol of love?
                        Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan ordered construction in 1632 as a monument to his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
                        The stunningly beautiful structure, considered the height of Indo-Islamic architecture, was
                        completed in 1648.
                        The white marble structure is in Agra, about 212 kilometers (132 miles) south of India’s
                        capital, New Delhi.
                        <span>Best time to go:</span> Late spring and early summer in this part of India has often
                        brutal heat (but
                        fewer crowds). Then come monsoons. November to February is your best chance for pleasant
                        weather. The sunrises here are highly admired.
